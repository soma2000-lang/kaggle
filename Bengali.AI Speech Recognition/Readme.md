The goal of this project is to recognize Bengali speech from out-of-distribution audio recordings. You will build a model trained on the first Massively Crowdsourced (MaCro) Bengali speech dataset with 1,200 hours of data from ~24,000 people from India and Bangladesh. The test set contains samples from 17 different domains that are not present in training.

Your efforts could improve Bengali speech recognition using the first Bengali out-of-distribution speech recognition dataset. In addition, your submission will be among the first open-source speech recognition methods for Bengali.
